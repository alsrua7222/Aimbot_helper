/*
This code illustrates how to detect movement and mouse event information coming from a Tablet
Bear in mind that when AHI receives input from a tablet...
... the "packet" of information always includes movement AND button state information
When AHI fires the callbacks, it always fires movement callbacks before button callbacks...
... so you can be sure that when ButtonEvent() fires, it always has the latest coordinates
